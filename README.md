#Terminologies

## Acyclic Graph
A graph that has no cycles

## Array
A linear collection of data values that are accessible at numbered indices, 
starting at index 0.



## Balanced Binary Tree
A binary tree whose nodes all have left and right subtrees whose heights differ
by no more than 1.

A balanced binary tree is such that the algorithmic time complexity of its 
operations is maintained.

## Big O Notation
The notation used to describe the time complexity and space complexity of algorithms

 - Constant: O(1)
 - Logarithmic: O(log(n))
 - Linear: O(n)
 - Log-linear: O(nlog(n))
 - Quadratic: O(n<sup>2</sup>)
